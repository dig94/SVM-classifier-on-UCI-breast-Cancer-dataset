# SVM-classifier-on-UCI-breast-Cancer-dataset

## 1. Load breast cancer dataset from sklearn
## 2. Split the data as 70:30 as train and test data
## 3. Fit the train data into SVM model with diffferent kernels
##    and bar plot the accuracy of different SVM model with the test data
## 4. Fit the above training dataset into a SVM model with ploynomial kernel
##    with varying degree and plot the accuracy wrt. degree of ploynomial kernel with the test data
## 5. Define a custom kernel K(X,Y)=K*XY'+theta where k and theta are constants
## 6. Use the custom kernel and report the accuracy with the given train and test dataset
